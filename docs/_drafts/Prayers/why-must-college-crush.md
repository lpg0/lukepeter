title: Commit Me

---
Lord. My life is an offering, I want to live a life worthy. Lord, I pray the difficult prayer with honesty - do what you will with me but give me more of Jesus. Here I am before your throne, the throne of mercy and righteousness. Please Oh Father shape my being by your power. Carve out my sin and self interest. Forgive me for my vain independence. I see how you have taken away that I might be brought low before you. I give in Father. Commit me to your strong hand.
