title: Let Me Honor

---
Father, you created me as a being in your image with full capacities for love, devotion, and strength. You yourself portrayed this perfectly through your son Jesus, for he was fully man and tempted in every regard as I am. Lord as I step through this day striving to live in light of this Person, let your Holy Spirit move powerfully to shape me. Clean my heart, mind, and spirit as I walk, renew and uphold me. Oh God I do not come before your throne believing that you have little power to work, in fact Lord I know you are greater in power than is comprehensible. So use my efforts to glorify your name, purpose them for your kingdom. I know your will for me - it is clearly revealed in your Word. Fill me with your love Oh God, for I cannot but step in faith, you are the one that provides the growth and fullness. May I come to live in this love, and may I come to live ever closer to your good design. May I even today live out an honor that only flows from you.
