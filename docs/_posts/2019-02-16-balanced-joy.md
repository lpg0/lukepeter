title: Balanced Joy
---

Balance is hard. 

Have you ever felt like you can never get to the things you want to do? The things you enjoy and love? You fill your time with good things, school, work, church, but never have the time to spend on what you care about?

Maybe you do care about school and work, but the challenge of being on time constraints and schedules delimits your joy? I feel that. 

I can go about my day doing all the right things – campus fellowship, homework, going to class… But by the end of the day I feel down. There is a weight on my spirit that can build week after week, assignment after assignment, motion after motion.

A common feeling is emptiness. A hollowness that lays on the mind and spirit. Left untouched it grows and spreads, deepens and takes root. It may not be depressive, but it is very impressive. One can feel it.

Without a solid friend nearby to peer into my life and examine my actions and spirit, I never would have caught it! It was so subtle. The question asked to me was not complicated. Do you enjoy? Questions like these can be simple and straightforward and which speak to the craving of every human soul for enjoyment. Are you enjoying school? Are you enjoying your classes? If you are not, what else are you doing that you enjoy? And I am not speaking to happiness. School is hard. That’s not always a happy thing. But striving hard at school and reaping the benefits of that hard work can be enjoyable.

The truth is… We were made for more than just work.

I have a really hard time wrapping my mind around this concept. Like God is okay with me not trying to be 100% productive all day long? So often I am almost controlled by the felt need to get as many things done as I possibly can, or if when I have “free time” to fill it with some uplifting book that I have not touched in week, or to catch up on my Bible reading plan that I am behind in… Filling my day with just stuff. Activities that are not bad things, but do not fulfill at the end of the day. The struggle comes in shifting away from an attitude of total productivity, because the result may be guilt.

Sabbath can be a very difficult subject.

Who is God when it comes to my productivity? Who is God in my rest? Who is God in relation to my fun?

Over the next couple weeks, I want to explore these conversations, with you. I want to challenge my theology and life actions by holding them up to the word of God. I hope to practically put them under scrutiny and pose real questions that will encourage and effect change.

What is driving your day?

I would love nothing more than to talk to you! Please reach out to me via the contact page. Let's have these discussions together!
