title: I Am Nothing

"Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly." - Proverbs 16:11

Oh God this is me. The sin that besets me is clear, and agonizing. I see my sin! My flesh is against the things of you Lord, despite how my spirit has changed. Father I am a sinner. I do the things I do not want to do. Is there hope?

Thanks be to you. You have made a way. If obtaining this salvation was about my performance, Father there is no hope. But you have given me a gift that surpasses the unworthiness of my flesh, an immeasurable gift. Thank you Jesus.

"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. **2** For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. **3** For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, **4** in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit." - Romans 8:1-4
