Lord, you know when things are difficult. You know how I feel, what I think, and what I do. And oftentimes I am ashamed of these things. You see through my intense analytical mind, and you know where I am at. Father I want to grow, I want to figure things out! But your timing is better than mine. I trust you Lord that in my humble stumbling you have a good plan, and that it has a purpose. O Lord I give up trying to be wholly perfect, and accept the position you have brought me to. Forgive me for trying to be somewhere you do not want me. Here I am Oh Lord, I will be present where I am and in the moment, seeking to live by faith in the small things. Knowing that I am mere man and you are God. I rest in your bigness and believe that as I do the small things right you will cause the greater things to fall into place.

"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." - Mathew 6:33
