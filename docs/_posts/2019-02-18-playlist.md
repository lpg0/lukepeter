Here are a couple songs I have listened to in the past week... In light of Valentines day I thought it would be fitting to consider love. Particularly the love of the one who embodies it completely. If I could make a mathematical formula for what some people believes the character of God to be like, I would assume it would look something like this:

Let <var>k</var> represent the number of character attributes of God, and let <var>n</var> represent some character attribute of God, such that <var>n<sub>0</sub></var> + <var>n<sub>1</sub></var> + <var>n<sub>2</sub></var> + ... + <var>n<sub>k</sub></var>, where <var>n<sub>0</sub></var> = (10% justice), <var>n<sub>1</sub></var> = (10% righteousness), <var>n<sub>0</sub></var> = (10% love),...

Does this seem odd to you? Definetly does to me. Let me give you a better one.

Let <var>k</var> represent the number of character attributes of God, and let <var>n</var> represent some character attribute of God, such that <var>n<sub>0</sub></var> + <var>n<sub>1</sub></var> + <var>n<sub>2</sub></var> + ... + <var>n<sub>k</sub></var>, where <var>n<sub>0</sub></var> = (100% justice), <var>n<sub>1</sub></var> = (100% righteousness), <var>2<sub>0</sub></var> = (100% love),...

Catch the difference?

God's love is perfect. Complete. Do we believe that? Does it change anything? Send me a message and let me know what you think!
