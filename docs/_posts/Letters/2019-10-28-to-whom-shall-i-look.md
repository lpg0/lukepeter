title: To Whom Shall I Look?

---
I will lift mine eyes unto the hills, where does my strength come from? My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. You are the one I need, Oh God! You provide for my souls desire, forgive me for seeking satisfaction in lesser things. Oh Lord be my all, take away my dependence on this world and scrape away my fleshly lusts. Be bigger to me. Hear me now.
